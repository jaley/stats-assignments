\section{Analysis of a Journal Article}

This article discusses statistical elements of the analyses in a
medical study focusing on the impact coffee consumption may have on
risk of individuals later suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus
\cite{vandam}.

The study is a prospective analysis, using individuals
selected randomly from public registers in two Dutch
towns. Participants were sent a questionnaire to record various
aspects of their lifestyle considered relevant to the
study. Importantly, this of course covered how much coffee the
participants consumed, measured in cups/day, but also various other
factors that were thought to be possibly confounding in the study.

We note at this point that this is necessary, as though the study is
prospective, it is \emph{not} a clinical trial. We do have an element
of randomization to help control for confounds, but the explanatory
variable of interest, the  amount of coffee consumed by each
individual, has not been actively manipulated as a part of the
study. The study therefore can only hope to demonstrate a strong
association between coffee consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes. We
will see later, however, that some considerable effort is made to
monitor the impact of potentially confounding factors.

The study excludes a number of individuals upfront as part of the
design. This includes people that are under 30 years old, pregnant, or
had missing information in the survey. After these exclusions, the
total number of participants was 17,111. These individuals were sent
follow-up questionnaires over subsequent years to check whether they
had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. In total, 306 such cases were
recorded in the study.

A 95\% confidence interval for incidence of type 2 diabetes within
this population would therefore be (0.016, 0.020), with estimated
value 0.017. Other studies placed overall population incidence for the
Netherlands at 2.2\% in 2003 \cite{prevalence}. It seems likely that
the age restrictions on this study (30-60 years) may explain this
slightly lower observation in the study cohort. However, we would also
expect there to be some selection bias, in that participants diagnosed
with diabetes may be more enthusiastic to respond to follow-ups than
others.

The article covers some measures used to monitor and control for
potential confounds in the analysis. This seems like a good idea, as
coffee consumption is likely to correlate quite strongly with various
other lifestyle choices that could have an impact. Many such potential
confounding factors are identified in the study, but we should note
that this highlights one of the main drawbacks in this kind of
study. In order to test for confounds, we have to propose and
enumerate them. It is entirely plausible that others exist, that we're
unable to foresee at the beginning of the study, when designing the
questionnaire for participants to complete. We therefore would have no
data about such factors and be unable to control for them when
interpreting the results.

The article states that for each of the characteristics they measured
in participants, tests for correlation with coffee consumption were
``obtained by modeling the median value of each category of coffee
consumption as a continuous variable''. It's not entirely clear what
is meant by this, as no further details are provided in other parts of
the article, however the need to map consumption categories to a
continuous variable perhaps suggests some kind of regression analysis
is being used.

These tests find that coffee consumption correlates
somewhat with all characteristics except for cardiovascular disease
and consumption of dark bread. One of the more surprising elements of
this study is that those characteristics showing positive correlation
with coffee consumption are generally considered to have a negative
impact on health. If we were to attribute the conclusions in this
study to the confounding factors considered here, it would perhaps be
even more surprising than attributing it to coffee consumption anyway.

The study makes use of the \emph{Cox proportional hazards model}
\cite{cox} to estimate relative risk for participants as a function of
their coffee consumption, time and other factors suspected to be
confounding. This is a time-series analysis technique, which seems
like a sensible choice, given that we cannot ignore how time plays an
important role in the diagnosis of diseases such as type 2
diabetes. We do not have an immediately measurable response variable;
all we know is that a participant has or has not \emph{yet} been
diagnosed. Censoring therefore plays an important role in interpreting
the results.

The Cox proportional hazards model relies on the \emph{proportional
  hazards assumption}, given below:

\begin{equation}
h_{z}(t) = g(z)h_{0}(t)
\end{equation}

Where \(z\) is a vector of explanatory variables, \(h_{0}(t)\) is the
baseline or nominal hazard function and \(g(z)\) is a function of
\emph{only} the explanatory variables (not time), which we multiply by
the baseline hazard rate to obtain the hazard function taking \(z\)
into account. Thus we assume that the impact of \(z\) does not vary
with time beyond the base hazard rate.

It's very hard to check whether this assumption is reasonable, as we
don't know what (if anything) in coffee could be helping to prevent
type 2 diabetes. We certainly have no information to tell us whether
such an effect with vary with time, whether it be how long a
participant has been drinking coffee at the specified quantity, their
age or length of exposure to potential causes.
